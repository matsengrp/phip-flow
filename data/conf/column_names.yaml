# Columns Name configuration file (YAML)

# Most of the phippery functions rely on one or more columns
# be present in the dataset. In order to document and
# allow for modification of these columns, we document them here.

# The top level is dimension names. This will determine the
# axis by which we perform oporations. 
# If "factor_levels" is included in column keys, then the factor
# level groups in any one columns must be the only existing 

# running list of possible functions that may require the columns
# described for each dimension table:
#
# Is this the right place for this? maybe this config file is just
# for the built-in workflows 

# 1. alignment-counts-workflow
# 2. fold-enrichment-workflow
